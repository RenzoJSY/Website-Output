		Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

		<p><em>Hummus</em></p>
		that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. 
		It deserves it. All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. It's got chickpeas, 
		sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and<strong> olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong> It's convenient to buy a 
		plastic container of hummus at the store, but youâ€™d be surprised at how easy it is to whip up at 
		home. You'll save a few bucks and know exactly what's in your hummus.

		<dd>Hummus<img src="images\hummus2.jpeg" width="100" height="100" alt="hummus"> is a smooth and creamy puree of cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans), 
			tahini sesame paste and an acid, typically lemon juice. While hummus usually has garlic now, 
			centuries ago it did not. Olive oil isn't a requirement either, but most modern recipes list it as an ingredient
